        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This simple hummus recipe results in a versatile spread that can be used 
            with anything from pita bread and crackers to sandwiches and fruit. It 
            provides a large amount of fiber and protein and is the perfect way to 
            start the day.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>15-ounce can chickpeas</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/4 cup well-stirred tahini</li>
            <li>1 small garlic clove, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>2-3 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>Dash ground paprika or sumac</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In the bowl of a food processor, combine the tahini and lemon 
                juice and process for 1 minute, scrape the sides and bottom of 
                the bowl then process for 30 seconds more. This extra time helps 
                "whip" or "cream" the tahini, making the hummus smooth and creamy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the olive oil, minced garlic, cumin, and a 1/2 teaspoon of 
                salt to the whipped tahini and lemon juice. Process for 30 seconds, 
                scraped the sides and bottom of the bowl then process another 30 
                seconds or until well blended. Open, drain, and rinse the chickpeas. 
                Add half of the chickpeas to the food processor and process for 1 
                minute. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, then add remaining 
                chickpeas and process until thick and quite smooth; 1-2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Most likely the hummus will be too thick or still have tiny bits 
                of chickpea. To fix this, with the food processor turned on, slowly 
                add 2 to 3 tablespoons of water until you reach the perfect consistency.
            </li>
            <li>
                Taste for salt and adjust as needed. Serve hummus with a drizzle of 
                olive oil and dash of paprika. Store homemade hummus in an airtight 
                container and refrigerate up to one week.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Tips</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Can use canned or home-cooked chickpeas (canned is much easier)
            </li>
            <li>
                Could increase the amount of garlic if you prefer a strong garlic 
                flavor in hummus 
            </li>
        </ul>
