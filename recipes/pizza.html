        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This is a recipe for a pizza margherita. With just a few ingreidents 
            and a total prep time of 15 minutes, you get a thin-crust pizza that 
            could compete with the best Italian restaurants out there.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>12-inch round of pizza dough, stretched</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons tomato sauce</li>
            <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2.75 ounces fresh mozzarella</li>
            <li>4 to 5 basil leaves, roughly torn</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place a pizza stone or tiles on the middle rack of your oven and 
                turn heat to its highest setting. Let it heat for at least an hour.
            </li>

            <li>
                Put the sauce in the center of the stretched dough and use the back 
                of a spoon to spread it evenly across the surface, stopping 
                approximately 1/2 inch from the edges.
            </li>

            <li>
                Drizzle a little olive oil over the pie. Break the cheese into large 
                pieces and place these gently on the sauce. Scatter basil leaves 
                over the top.
            </li>

            <li>
                Using a pizza peel, pick up the pie and slide it onto the heated 
                stone or tiles in the oven. Bake until the crust is golden brown 
                and the cheese is bubbling, approximately 4 to 8 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Tip</h4>
        <p><em>
            In a food processor, whiz together whole, drained canned tomatoes, a 
            splash of olive oil, and a sprinkle of salt. Keep leftover sauce 
            refrigerated.
